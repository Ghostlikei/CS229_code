# CS229_code
A repo storing personal solution for coding assignment in Stanford CS229: Machine Learning

For ps4, unzip mnist.zip and make *.csv into the same dir with code.ipynb and nn_starter.py

This repo contains my code solution to **Stanford CS229 Fall 2018**. For the latest open vertion of CS229, and other notes, please refer to other repos on Github or course websites. If any problem or needs for my written solution, please contact me through email (I love hand writting math rather than Latex)

## Remarks

For a CS student, **Stanford CS229** is definitely the **best** gateway course if you want to do something with ML in the future. Andrew Ng designed the course and gave you a clear big picture about the classic topics in ML, including Supervised Learning, Learning theory, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. That laid you a solid foundation for whatever you work with later.
